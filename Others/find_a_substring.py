# A word made of a series of letters ( lower or upper ) or numerics or an
# underscore _ ( ascii value 95).

# We define a substring as follows.

# It is a part of a word.
# The given substring must be preceeded and succeeded by letters or numerics or
# an underscore.
# A word will be surrounded by 1 or more occurrences of non-letter, non-numeric
# and non-underscore ( not an underscore ) characters.

# <non letter, non-numeral ,non-underscore ><letters, numerals and
# <underscore><non letter, non numerals, non underscore>
# Given a sentence, can you find the total number of occurrences of the
# substring?

# Input Format

# First line is an integer N, N lines follow. Each line is a sentence as per the
# above definition.
# Nth sentence is immediately followed by an integer T, T lines follow.
# Each line has a lists a substring on which you need to perform the prescribed
# query which return the total number of occurrences of the substring.

# Constraints

# 1 <= N <= 100
# 1 <= T <= 10

# Output format

# For every word, print the total number of occurrences of the substring in all
# of the N sentences provided as input.

# Sample Input

# 1
# existing pessimist optimist this is
# 1
# is
# Sample Output

# 3
# Explanation

# 'existing' has 'is' as a substring and is both preceded and succeeded by words
# as defined above.
# 'pessimist' has 'is' as a substring for the same argument as above.
# 'optimist' has 'is' as a substring for the same argument as above.
# 'this' though has 'is' as a substring is only preceded by a word and is
# succeeded by a [blank space] which is non-letter, non-numeric and
# non-underscore
# 'is' is not included as it is not preceded and succeeded by a [blank space]
# which is non-letter, non-numeric and non-underscore.
